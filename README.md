The purpose of this script is to simplify the installation of DaVinci Resolve to the maximum using Distrobox with Fedora 37 inside it. It can be used on any Linux distribution compatible with Distrobox in its repository. The installation is almost completely automated, including the installation of Distrobox and a guide during the installation process. To work correctly, it is necessary to have the DaVinci Resolve installer and the script in the same folder. Simply run the valsolv script in the terminal and it will take care of the rest. To run it, within the directory use the command sh valsolv.sh.
